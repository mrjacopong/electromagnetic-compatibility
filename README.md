# Welcome  to the Electromagnetic Compatibility Notes repo!  
  
This  is  the  repository  where you can  find  my Electromagnetic Compatibility class notes,  taken  for the first  part  of the  course  of "*ELECTROMAGNETIC  COMPATIBILITY M*" at  [MUNER  University](https://motorvehicleuniversity.com).  
  
##  How  did  I  have  worked  
During university lectures  I  have taken notes on my  notebook, then  I  reported  them on  **LaTeX**.  
  
##  Why latex?  
Because I  really  enjoy  writing in  **LaTeX**, and it  helped  me a  lot  to  study  better and  fixing  some tedious concepts.  
  
##  Why to  share  it here with everyone  
BECAUSE I  LOVE  YOU!  
Just kidding, I really like to think  that  my  hard work could be helpful to someone of you, and i  think  that it is the perfect  spot to show  my  my  new learned skill.  
  
##  Why  are  you  so proud of your  work?  
I have  written  every  line  of  code, and if  you  open  the  .tex  files  you  can notice that every  image  has been done with  **tikz**. No  image  taken  from  internet  has been  used! Of course  I got helped by  *stackoverflow*, but the  most  of  images  was made by myself. 

### How to compile the code
You need a working LaTeX distribution (I am using MiKTeX).
Use pdflatex and bibtex to build the code,
To be 100% sure of the result you should use this recipe in order: pdflatex -> bibtex -> pdflatex -> pdflatex

  
###  disclaimer:  
Of course  it  is  not a  perfect  work, and  it  has  **a lot of  errors**, this  is  why  it  is here on  github. I would  really  appreciate your  contribution  if  you  spot  some  mistake: you  can  both  send  an  issue  (please be as precise as possible)  or  you  can  just  send  me a pull request.  
For every  correction, please  send  me the  reference  where  you  find  the  correction  and  give  a little bit of  context  (as I have  explained  on the issue template).
